<h1>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern businesses</h1>

<P>
    Information technology drives innovation and innovation is the path to business success. Innovation in business has the same impact that steam had on the industrial revolution.

    <br>
    <br>
    In fact, it’s hard to imagine any business that has not benefited from the digital revolution. Even something as hands on as agriculture uses computers. Farmers use computers for production records, financial planning, research on technical issues, and procurement.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    Nowadays the formula for business success is simple: drive innovation with information technology. So, the first thing startups in any industry try to figure out is how to make smart IT recruiting choices. Without a backbone of information technology, a business is not going to go far.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <b> The Love Affair with Innovation</b>
    <br>
    We like to imagine that the human race has always been innovative. But innovation was a slow and steady affair for most of the 20th century. It was the work of individual genius or think tanks. For the most part, brilliant people innovated and the public slowly adopted the idea. The mainstream love affair with innovation began with the invention of the computer. It attained momentum with the birth of the Internet.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    In the 1980s, innovation was not necessary for business success. A business could do well just deploying a proven business model. Efficiency was not a prime directive.
    Following tradition was a sensible way to stay in business. A store owner, for example, was content with using a cash register similar to the one invented by James Ritty in 1879 to prevent his employees from pilfering his saloon profits in Dayton, Ohio.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    All this changed on 6 August 1991, a little-remembered date, when the World Wide Web went live to the world. There was hardly a mention of it in any newspaper on the planet. Most people around globe had no idea that the Internet existed. Although Tim Berners-Lee’s invention changed the world as we know it, it was only toward the end of the decade that the Internet became popular.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>The Rise of Innovation</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    The rise of innovation can be traced to the human race getting smarter. According to the Flynn Effect, general IQ has begun to rise since the 1930s. The average IQ has risen from 80 points to 100 points.
    <br>
    <br>
    While innovations in travel and multimedia improved collective intelligence, these were mainly passive forms of learning. Today, computer applications and the global brain have switched on active learning and improved how fast people learn new things.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Innovation in Business</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Information technology fosters innovation in business. Innovation results in smarter apps, improved data storage, faster processing, and wider information distribution. Innovation makes businesses run more efficiently. And innovation increases value, enhances quality, and boosts productivity.
    Innovation through information technology has created the following radical changes in business:
    
    <br>
    <br>
    · Online shopping is more efficient than shopping in a store.
    · Digital marketing is more efficient than high cost newspaper, television, and radio advertising.
    · Social networking is more efficient than going to clubs.
    · VoiP communication is more efficient than legacy telephony.
    · Cloud computing is more efficient than a private computer network.
    <br>
    <br>
    Businesses that have embraced the innovation paradigm tend to have the following characteristics:
    · They have more accurate business planning
    · They have more effective marketing
    · They have higher global sales
    · They have more systematic management
    · They use real time monitoring
    · They offer instant customer support
    <br>
    <br>
    
    In fact, it’s hard to thing of long term business growth without the push of information technology.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Five Reasons for Accelerated Business Growth</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    The technological revolution has improved businesses this century in the following five primary ways:
    
    <br>
    <br>
    1. Information technology has given business the tools to solve complex problems.
    Improved hardware (more memory, faster processors, sharper visual displays, etc) combined with smarter applications (Mindmapping software like X Mind, collaborative software like Kanban boards, organizers like Google calendar, etc) have made it easier to research data, analyze it, and plan scalability. Many tools available to solve complex problems.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    2. Information technology allows businesses to make better decisions.
    Good decisions in business are based on solid market research. This can be done through engaging teams through video conferences, reviewing public sentiment on social media and industry forums, and using online surveys to get customer feedback. There are also tools like Microsoft CRM Dynamics and Google Analytics.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    3. Information technology has improved marketing.
    Internet marketing using online advertising methods (SEO, PPC, Facebook Ads) are far more accurate ways than traditional marketing of finding target audiences, discovering their needs, and building a marketing campaign to persuade them to buy. It’s difficult to see how many people read a newspaper ad. It’s easy to figure out how many people clicked on an online banner.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    4. Information technology has improved customer support.
    Customers can receive support from multiple channels telephone, emails, social media platforms, webinars, and so on. Additionally, customer relationship management systems help businesses understand customer behavior.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    5. Information technology has improved resource management.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    Cloud computing allows a company’s employees to use any device anywhere in the world to access their enterprise level software.
    Innovation is the Wave of the Future
    
    <br>
    <br>
    If the purpose of business is to increase profits, then innovation is the way to make more profits, faster. The story of Jan Koum gives us a clue how much big businesses value innovation. He went from food stamps to billionaire because of his invention of WhatsApp.

<h1>1.2 Methods, Skills & Resources
    needed to complete Digital Projects Successfully</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
<b>Q1. What do you need to make projects successful?</b>
        <BR>
<p>Digital research projects involve the transformation of objects of scholarly interest, including texts and images, into electronic form for specialized, enhanced, or remote analysis.

A digital project comprises the planning, preparation, and production that goes into creating electronic publications. Possible electronic publications include: Web sites, electronic books, digital images, etc.
                
Benefits of a Digital Project
                
                A primary benefit of digital projects is that one encoded text document may produce multiple output options. In addition, the project may include any combination of audio, visual, or textual features.
                
                Further benefits of encoding text for Internet access include:
                
                the prevention of damage to rare and fragile material by displaying the material online
                allowing access to material online that would otherwise be unavailable
                online searching of material that could not be searched in other formats
                Materials for a Digital Project
                
                The following is a list of the basic equipment that is needed to work on a digital project.
                
                material to encode
                a computer with a text editor
                software to process the encoding
                The Center will provide the computer equipment and software needed to work on a digital project.
                
                Things to Consider
                
                When selecting materials to encode for a digital project, it is useful to discuss the value of the project and whether similar projects have already been encoded elsewhere.
                
                Other issues to consider include:
                
                availability of materials for encoding
                copyright issues
                time constraints
                financial resources
                material resources
                where the finished project might be published
                the server on which the finished project will be located
                the intended audience
                the goals of the project</p>
            <BR>
                <p>
                    <b> Q2. What tools do you need to make projects successful?</b>
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The Trello system is one good example in this particular situation. Trello is built on the Japanese management "kanban" principle, which involves consistent monitoring of all production phases. It is a great tool for standerd projects and is convenient for both command and directives and individual assessments.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Trello interface consists of diffrent boards, which represent projects or proceses in the company. Each bord consists of lists of tasks, cards with descriptions, comments, files and colour tags and dedlines. The menu can be displayed as a calendar--the basic functionality of Trello is free and allows you to work with almost no restrictions.      
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>Q3. What skills set do you need to make projects successful?</b> 
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>

                    1. Copywriting & Editing

                    Almost every marketing position requires writing and editing skills in today’s “content is king” environment, and digital project marketers are no exception. No matter how many people are on the team you’re project managing, time will be of the essence, and it’s likely that you’ll need to at least take a quick proofread of some content. You may even need to do a bit of copywriting. You’ll also need to communicate efficiently with clients and vendors, so the ability to write clear and concise emails that people can easily understand is important. Finally, you’ll need at least some understanding of good design and content practices to connect writers and designers. Let them stick to their strengths--you’ll keep everyone on track and help when you need to.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    2. Problem-Solving
                    
                    Problem-solving is a key part of a DPM’s everyday activities. This role includes tasks that are typical of most project management jobs, such as timeline planning, budget tracking and scope management but also features responsibilities that sometimes sit with product managers, such as feature planning and testing. There are plenty of problems to solve, and no day will be the same!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    3. HTML/CSS
                    
                    HTML/CSS are the two languages of the internet. The ability to write in HTML allows DPMs to help designers or developers in a pinch. Many times, simple tasks such as adding text, formatting text and adding embedded videos can help take the pressure off of busy developers. If you don’t currently know HTML, try lynda.com or Codeacademy.com to get started.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    4. Social Media
                    
                    It’s arguable that everyone working in marketing needs to have some degree of social media knowledge. Digital project managers, specifically, need to understand the content limitations of each social media platform and how to use social media tools such as publishing platforms like Hootsuite and analytics platforms like Simply Measured.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    5. FTP
                    
                    Many companies use file transfer protocol (FTP) to connect to file systems and servers locally and online. Most people understand how to use public cloud sharing services such as Dropbox, but knowledge of FTP is crucial as an effective project manager. Even if your company doesn’t use an FTP service to share files, it’s likely that some of the vendors you work with will. Some popular FTP programs include File Zilla, Cyberduck and transmit.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    6. Negotiation Skills
                    
                    Deadlines are the bread and butter of DPMs. A great project manager knows how to work with their internal teams, external vendors and clients to control deadlines and manage scope changes. DPMs need to be able to successfully negotiate timelines, rates, contracts and expectations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    7. Reporting & Analytics
                    
                    All digital project managers must be able to collect data and interpret it. The first platform DPMs should learn to navigate is Google Analytics. Google’s step-by-step guide and free online course make it easy. You can even become certified for more industry credibility. You’ll also need to learn how to use any of the analytics tools your company uses.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    8. Attention to Detail
                    
                    It might seem obvious, but an eye for detail is incredibly important for project managers. Without a last look from these individuals, many campaigns go out with obvious issues such as spelling errors, links that don’t work or flawed user journeys.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    9. SEO Knowledge
                    
                    All companies want their content to be in the first page of Google. Being able to help your company achieve better rankings is an excellent skill to have. Search engine optimization helps connect your customers to great content. Sometimes copywriters and other marketing team members forget to include SEO as part of their process, but with your help--they won't!
                    
                    SEOmoz is a great site and software as a service (SaaS) tool to get started learning and optimizing your company’s content for SEO.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    10. Understanding Formal Project Management Methodologies
                    
                    Typically, project managers use specific methodologies to manage projects from a lifecycle perspective. It’s a great idea to get experience in such methodologies as Agile, Scrum and Waterfall if you don’t have it already. All projects are different in terms of their needs and complexity, but an understanding of at least one of two methodologies are necessary for most project management positions. Understanding how to use popular project management tools like Basecamp and Liquid Planner will also increase your value as a project manager.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    11. Relationship Building
                    
                    Do you enjoy working with many different types of people and cultivating relationships? As a DPM, you'll serve as the client lead and the advocate for your internal team. It's not unusual to be handling client communication, internal feedback and hands-on work in applications and programs. Through this process, you’ll be exposed to people many creative, passionate, and talented people, and you’ll work with every type of personality and communication style.

    <P> I started with a piece of paper and a pen, and following that I've learned that is was not the best way. So I've created a Trello Bord, with a to do list, things to be done, what to research, such as how to keep data organised. Therefore, Trello helped me a lot.

<h1>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital
    projects.
</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p><b>1. What causes digital projects to fail and why?</b>
        <BR>
            <BR>
<p>1. A few common risks and mitigations for creative digital projects* Not an exhaustive list, but a simple guide
    2. Ineffective or low impact change management Organisation resistant to change including key delivery departments – significant new processes and structures in place that may cause short term resistance Mitigation: Educate, Inform and communicate; above all else, listen
    3. Too many committee decisions Artistic direction becomes muddied due to too many stakeholders Mitigation: In the end something that is creative needs creative direction. Identify who does that straight from the go and define their influence and make it clear to everyone, that they are the final arbiter.
    4. Differing departmental requirements Will delay launch and cause unsatisfied internal customers; following changes will cost more money. Mitigation: try to understand what they actually need not what they say they need.
    5. Project resources may be reallocated for other (higher) priority projects Resources are currently committed to this project. Losing a resource would severely delay project. Mitigation: Plan ahead and understand the rhythm of the business, where key events happen
    6. Departmental Capacity Too much to do, day-to-day tasks getting the way; not enough people or time and this project getting the way of BAU Mitigation: Understand workflows and demands, identify potential bottlenecks
    7. Inputs from departments will not be available when required Internal processes and workflows aren’t up to producing content on time. Mitigation: Identify potential bottlenecks in workflows, communicate what you want and by when
    8. Recruitment and Resources Can you find the right people in time to do the job? Do you have budget to go further to find them? Mitigation: Identify early and start recruiting early, use your networks
    9. Data Issues Data migration may result in loss of customer data. Customer data is key for day to day business operations. Mitigation: Whatever you make, data has to be at the heart from step 1.

<h1>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting
    and using IT systems and software
</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p><b>1. How do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</b>
        <BR>
            <BR>
                <p>
<b>Factors to consider when choosing technology</b>
It’s worth focusing your energies on the tech tools that will help you to grow your business (like lead generation systems) and streamline day-to-day operations so you can focus more on your core business.
                <br>
                <br>
<b>Consider what’s not working optimally</b>
Tech is only fulfilling its true function when it’s speeding up or otherwise improving existing processes. So, start your tech audit by assessing – as objectively as you can – what’s working and what’s not. By identifying your company’s pain points, you’ll be able to specify what you need to change to make a difference. For instance, if teams aren’t communicating as efficiently as they need to, introducing a collaboration platform like Slack could be a game-changer.
                <br>
                <br>
<b>Think about the future</b>
As well as looking at the things that are affecting your team right now, consider the impact of growth on your existing practices. If staff are investing a lot of time managing repetitive tasks, imagine how this will play out if you expand your operation or extend your customer reach. Examine potential tech solutions with scalability in mind but don’t blow the budget on a level of sophistication you simply don’t need right now.
                <br>
                <br>
<b>Calculate the cost of implementation</b>
If you’re considering a tech solution that’s new to everyone in your organization, remember to factor in the cost of upskilling your team. Even if your chosen tech is hands-down the best fit for your business’s needs, you have to reflect on how it will impact productivity until your people are up to speed. You can circumvent this problem to some extent by choosing a managed solution that will support the tech without overloading your in-house IT resource.
                <br>
                <br>
<b>Take your time</b>
Businesses – especially startups – can cave into the pressure to pitch themselves ahead of the technology curve. It’s best to keep a clear head when pulling your tech together, focusing on the tools that facilitate your business goals, rather than on a bunch of optional extras that won’t add anything – other than cost – to your bottom line. Pick the tools that meet your objectives and address your pain points, so you can open up opportunities for future growth.
                <br>
                <br>
<b>How to choose an IT vendor</b>
Choosing the right IT vendor is just as important as choosing the right IT solution. Once contracted, your vendor will become your IT partner, so make sure you pick an organization you feel happy to collaborate with. They should be keen to learn everything they can about you, your team and your business and will have the expertise to guide and support you as you move forward together. The more closely you and your partner are aligned, the more successful your relationship is likely to be.
                <br>
                <br>
That said, you should also consider how engaged you need your IT vendor to be, according to the expected length of their commitment. If your IT project is a one-off installation that will be managed by your in-house team going forward, you’ll take a very different approach than if you’re recruiting a fully managed service with the capacity to support a project over a number of years.
                <br>
                <br>
<b>Open and honest</b>
Guard against companies that over-promise and under-deliver. It’s often wiser to go with an organization that honestly admits the extent of what they can and can’t provide, rather than to be tempted by a snake oil salesman who’s being economical with the truth. Do your due diligence and take up client references to validate vendors’ claims – and make sure you repay their honesty with some of your own.
 Naturally, you’re also looking for a level of expertise that is capable of transforming the way you do business. The best IT vendors are proactive – they will take a fresh look at your operation and work out how their solution can best serve your needs, so talk frankly about what you want to achieve and invite input.
                <br>
                <br>
<b>Coming to an agreement</b>
When you’ve selected your preferred vendor, you’ll need to agree terms. There’s often some wiggle room in the pricing model but be prepared to pay a fair price for the service you need. Legal and finance departments will work through the deal line-by-line, so expect this to affect the start date and build a few extra weeks into your schedule.
                <br>
                <br>
<b>Choosing a tech stack</b>
If you’re involved in a project that’s a little more complicated than average – if you’re creating your own app, for instance – you’ll have to select the ‘tech stack’ that will power your application before the first line of code can be written. Also known as ‘solution stacks’, the components they contain will provide all the elements needed to run an application and process complex instructions.
Your software stack will likely comprise an operating system, database, web server and web application framework, although they may include other components such as a programming language, software server or client interface. Selecting a tech stack can be problematic but if you break down the available options, you can narrow your search to a less overwhelming set of choices.
                <br>
                <br>
<b>Making decisions</b>
Decide first if you need to go mobile only with a native app (iOS before Android) for an audience of smartphone users or with a web app if your user base is primarily desktop based or has a complex user interface. It’s costlier to bring a native app to market but if your audience is mobile, you’ll need to cater for them.
<br>
<br>
Whether you’re designing for web or mobile, your time to market with a minimum viable product (MVP) will be key. By utilizing existing tools, you’ll significantly reduce the pre-launch development period, so begin by identifying the best open source tools in your sector and mirror their tech stack.
                <br>
                <br>
Use a back-end provider such as Parse rather than developing your own – and check out Github for the latest community developments. You’ll often find that the best tools spark a healthy developer community – witness the success of Magento and open source ecommerce platform Spree.  
                <br>
                <br>
Your choice of tech stack may depend, to some extent, on the expertise of your team, so make sure your preferred stack is well supported by available talent. Choose the tech stack that best serves you and you should have a solution that will take you to MVP and beyond.

    <p>Trello is a project management app, an easy and flexible tool to visually organise and manage your projects. Trello’s strength is its flexibility, that allows it to be used by a wide range of people, from teams to individuals.
<br> Trello is your best working companion, no matter your profession or life stage you're in.
    However, there are endless options when it comes to project management these days and it can be quite overwhelming to decide what app is the best one for you and your work. In this post, I'll share a Trello overview that will hopefully help you deciding if it's the right tool for you.

                    GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
<br>
                    This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests. You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
                    
                    No coding necessary
                    
                    To complete this tutorial, you need a GitHub.com account and Internet access. You don’t need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software GitHub is built on).

    <p>How does GDPR impact
        digital projects?
        <BR>
            <BR>
The Internet has dramatically changed the way we communicate and the way we manage our daily tasks.
We send e-mails, share documents, pay invoices and purchase goods by entering our personal data all online and without thinking again.
Have you ever stopped to wonder how much personal data you have shared online?
Or what about that information?
We're talking about banking information, contacts, addresses, social media posts, and even your IP address and the sites you've visited are stored digitally.
Companies tell you that they collect this type of information so that they can serve you better, provide you with more targeted and relevant communications, all to give you a better customer experience.
 But is that what I really use my data for?
This is the question that has been asked and answered by the EU and why a new European privacy regulation called GDPR was implemented in May 2018 and has permanently changed the way you, as a business, collect, store and use customer data. .
In a study of more than 800 IT and business professionals who are responsible for data privacy in companies with European clients, AIIM found that more than 50% of companies know little or nothing about GDPR.
More recently, TrustArc found that only 20% of companies now believe they are GDPR compliant.
The worst part?
More than 1 in 4 companies (27%) have not yet started working on their organization's compliance with the GDPR - more than 2 years after the May 25 deadline!
