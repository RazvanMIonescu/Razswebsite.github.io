    Finding stock objects and existing implementations is often quicker, cheaper and more practical than producing your own. Whether free or not, these resources normally come with a license to ensure fair use.

    Licenses are granted by an authority to allow a usage; in my case, the use and distribution of resources by the copyright owner (i.e. me). I may decide to offer my photograph for free or charge a price; either way, I can include a license to limit usage, and I maintain the copyright. Just because someone pays money doesn’t mean they have full control or rights to what they’re buying.
    What Is “Fair Use?
    ”“Fair use” is an exception to the exclusive rights held by the copyright owner. It exists in some countries such as the US and UK. Under it, in certain cases, using work without permission is possible. If someone’s usage is defined as fair use, then they don’t need to obtain a license. Essentially, using copyrighted material is a legal right. Examples of fair use might include:
    
    Educational purposes, such as teaching and student research;
    Making commentary and criticism as part of a news report or published article. 
    
    Copyright - Creative artist's control of original work: the legal right of creative artists or publishers to control the use and reproduction of their original works. You have to have permission before using it.
    
    Licensing - Permission to use something for your own reasons. e.g if you have authorization to use something like a song or an image.

    Approximately 54.4 million people, or 18.7% of the overall population, experience a form of disability in this nation. The number of people who experience a form of disability in America is expected to rapidly increase as the baby boom generation ages because 53% of people over the age of 75 have a form of disability.

People with disabilities already have to deal with notable challenges related to education and employment. We face a rate of unemployment that is more than 3 times as high as the rest of the population and experience similar gaps in educational achievement. Interestingly, 75% of people who experience a form of disability in America who are not employed want to work. Around 30% of high school graduates with disabilities enroll in a college, while 40% of the overall population does. One year after high school graduation, a mere 10% of students with disabilities enroll in two-year colleges, and a meager 5% enroll in four-year colleges.

Even though America has the world's most comprehensive policy related to Internet accessibility and clear guidance for creating accessible technologies is in existence, designers and developers of hardware technologies and Web software in academia, industry, and government many times exploit gaps in existing policies to ignore the needs of people who experience forms of disabilities. The result is that the majority of Internet-related technologies are created inaccessible and cut out some or even all users with disabilities.

People with disabilities already use the Internet and other types of technologies at levels that are below those of the rest of the population. The main reason why is not due to a lack of interest or education, but because the Internet itself is unfriendly to a people who experience various forms of disabilities. The barriers they face related to access and usage differ by type and extent of the disability a person has. Since the advent of the World Wide Web, many studies have shown the inaccessibility of web sites and additional elements of the Internet. More recent studies of accessibility concerning U.S. government web sites discovered that at least 90% of them have major barriers to access, even though they are supposed to have been accessible for almost 10 years under law. The levels of accessibility in educational and commerce setting are worse.

Challenging Internet Interfaces

People with various abilities clearly face various challenges when accessing the Internet. People who experience visual impairments may face challenges due to a lack of compatibility of Web content with the screen reader they use, a software application that provides computer-synthesized speech output of items appearing on the screen, as well as equivalent text provided in the back-end code. Screen readers usually have issues when designers fail to place appropriate text tags on links, graphics, tables, or forms.

People who experience motor impairments, such a limited or no use of their hands or fingers, may face barriers due to a cluttered layout, links and buttons that are too small, as well as other important navigability considerations such as requiring the use of a pointing device, that may make entire functions and sites unusable for them. For people who have hearing impairments, a lack of textual equivalents of audio content can many times cut out entire portions of content from a site and interactive Web chats and additional conferencing features might be entirely impossible. People who experience communication and speech impairments may also be excluded from interactive Web chats and other conferencing features. For people with cognitive impairments such as dementia, autism, or traumatic brain injury - problems with layout, design, and navigability make the difference between the ability to use a site or not. People with specific forms of learning disabilities might face the same barriers as those with visual impairments, or people with cognitive impairments. For people with seizure disorders, the flicker rates and flash may actually jeopardize their health!

A person's experiences with the Internet many times vary depending upon the form of disability they experience. The same web site often offers opportunities for one group while excluding another entirely. A student who uses a wheelchair might find that the ability to take online educational courses makes the educational process easier for them. Yet if the course web site is not designed to be accessible for students who experience limited hand mobility - participation in the course might be limited, or even impossible.

In the same way, a web-enabled mobile device with a touch screen might appear miraculous to a person with a hearing impairment, yet be a nightmare for a person with a visual impairment if it is not designed to provide alternative methods for interacting with it. The Internet and the technologies related to it present a complex series of issues for people with disabilities, not only as an overall population, but as separate populations within the whole related to the specific disabilities people experience.

While the range of potential barriers to people who experience disabilities in the online environment is extensive, there are ways to develop and implement technologies so they are included. There are known and achievable ways to address the access barriers mentioned. Many developers of web sites and related new technologies; however, just do not consider people with disabilities when they either create or update their products. Interestingly, the inaccessible web sites and technologies that are the results of this blatant disregard of accessibility run against federal civil rights laws for people with disabilities. A number of the issues of inclusion and exclusion online for people with disabilities have been considered in both policy and law, yet the conceptions of disability under the law, exemptions from compliance, limited enforcement, as well as the inability of the law to keep pace with technological development, all hinder the impact that the laws in America have had to date.

Despite the barriers people with disabilities face, the Internet has been viewed as having incredible potential related to promoting social inclusion of people with disabilities. In the year 2000, people with disabilities who were able to access and use the Internet were reporting noticeably larger benefits from the Internet in some areas than the general population. Adults with disabilities in the year 2000 were more likely to believe the Internet:

Improved the quality of their lives
Made them better informed about the world
Helped them meet people with similar interests and experiences
Gave them more connections to the world than the general population
At this time, some Internet technologies are significantly benefiting people with particular forms of disabilities. Other technologies are offering potential opportunities to every person with a disability.

Smartphones, while excluding a number of people with disabilities, have helped many others who experience speech, hearing or other types of communication impairments and find themselves with the ability to use the phones to communicate face-to-face more efficiently than they had been able to previously. In the same way, using video chat, people with these forms of disabilities may now converse with others over the phone in new ways.

For a larger population of people with disabilities, the Internet has a great amount of potential to create new means of interaction and communication through online communities devoted to specific forms of disabilities. A person who may never encounter someone else who experiences a similar disability in their physical environment may now interact directly with others who have similar disabilities anywhere in the world. For people whose disabilities limit their ability to leave home, the Internet has the potential to provide them with a much larger world of interaction. People with disabilities even have the choice to live their online lives as people without disabilities if they want to.

Beyond the clear communication and social benefits, the Internet offers people with disabilities an array of new ways to pursue employment and education. For people who may find it hard or even impossible to travel to a building for work or education, the Internet provides the ability to do either right from home. The potential benefits may be the best benefits in the long term for promoting social inclusion of people with disabilities given that the current levels of employment and education of people who experience disabilities is exceptionally low when compared with the rest of the population in America.

Due to the importance of these types of engagement with technology, the lack of equal access to the Internet will become an increasingly serious issue in the future. As more activities in the areas of employment, education, communication, and civic participation move primarily and then exclusively online, people with disabilities must be included. Inaccessible online education alone might seriously erode the ability of people with forms of disabilities to have a place in modern society.

An accessible Internet presents incredible potential to increase the inclusion of people with disabilities and facilitate online education, telework, participation in e-government, as well as the ability to form relationships that overcome barriers and challenges presented by the physical world. A new approach to public policy must be created that better eliminates the virtual barriers that are in place, ensuring that people with disabilities are not marginalized.

    1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes
for websites
</h1>
<p>
    With current browsers supporting more file types than ever before, it is important that you are clued up on which file formats work best on your website for different images. Do you know what format you should use for your logo? Or which format you should save your photographs in?
Using the wrong file format can affect the way images appear on your website and may determine whether users can in fact see those images. As well as this, incorrect file formats can have a negative effect on your page speed.
All images are made up from either raster or vector file types. Raster images are built through a series of pixels, whereas vector files are built using proportional formulas. Every photograph you see on any website will be a raster image and will be saved as either a JPEG, PNG or GIF. Vector images, on the other hand, are more complex and are typically saved as an SVG. They differ from raster images as they are not known to work well with photographs, instead they are perfect for graphics that require frequent resizing such as logos.
As there are many different file formats to choose from, we have selected the four we think work best on the web: a JPEG, PNG, SVG and GIF, all of which contain a lossy or lossless compression. A lossy compression means images lose information and quality once the file size decreases whereas a lossless compression does not lose any detail when the file size is changed.
JPEG
Joint Photographics Expert Group - otherwise known as a JPEG or JPG are the most popular choice when saving photographs as they are capable of containing over 16 million different colours. They are also a good choice for saving images with complex colour and shading.
JPEGs are probably the best file format for photographs on the web as the level of flexible compression when saving means they are capable of shrinking to a smaller file size and, therefore, they won’t have a negative effect on pagespeed. For example, a compressed 80KB image won’t take as long to load as a 8MB image as its smaller size means it requires less resources to load.
However, when it comes to graphics and text, JPEGS are not the best option as they use lossy compression, meaning they lose a lot of information when saved, making text or lines blurry in the process. Therefore, PNGs or GIFs would be the better choice.
As well as this, JPEGs, don’t support transparency, so it is worth keeping in mind if you want to place a transparent image on your website. We suggest you opt for a PNG instead.
Look at the example of the Apple logo below, can you see how the JPEG version has lots of grey spots around the edges? These are called artifacts which became visible as soon as it was saved as a JPEG. The reason why these two images appear different is because the JPEG compression introduces distortion caused by its lossy compression.
