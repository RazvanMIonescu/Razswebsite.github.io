       <h2 style="font-family: Apple Chancery;">My Interests in Technology and Coding</h2>
       <p1> Technology, is the application of scientific knowledge to the practical aims of human life or, as it is sometimes phrased, to the change and manipulation of the human environment. Therefore is part of our life and future as well. 
           <br>
           <br>
           Coding on the anothe hand is used for communicating with computers. People use coding to give computers and other machines instructions on what actions to perform. Further, we use coding to program the websites, apps, and other technologies we interact with every day.
           <br>
           <br>
           Therefore nowadays is vital to understand how technology and coding could improve our day to day lifes.
           <br>
           <br>
           Joining Code Nation, might be one of the most valuble experiences I had come across during the Corvid19. It is oparamont for each and eveyone of us to develop the necesary skills set in order to do our job better. But also, it is vital for our future to develop new skills in order to ensure we will have a future. For me, coding, has always been something that only the "smarts" can handle. However, after couple of weeks with Jay--the lecturer--I feel that I've learned a lot and probably the most important is that I feel that I want to learn more.
