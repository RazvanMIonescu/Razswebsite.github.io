<h1>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change
    approach as needed – in making your own
    website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
Trello and "kanban" principle, required consistent monitoring of all production phases. It was a great tool for me to assess my project and keep myself organised for both command and directives. However, I also have to recognise that wasn't that efficient that I was expected. For instance; for this particular case, becouse I had worked on my own to build this website -- I could work better with WBS without to have to waste time on Trello. 

The Trello interface consists of diffrent boards, which represent projects or proceses in the company but may not be suitable for small projects. Each bord consists of lists of tasks, cards with descriptions, comments, files and colour tags and dedlines. The menu can be displayed as a calendar--the basic functionality of Trello is free and allows you to work with almost no restrictions. Therefore, yes it is helpful but in the future I will chose to work with a WBS | worflow | gantchart insted of Trello.

    <h1>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were
        appropriate -- Visual Studio Code,
        Trello</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>In one hand, Trello system and "kanban" principle are a great tool for standerd projects and is convenient for both command and directives and individual assessments. However, Trello interface consists of diffrent boards, which represent projects or proceses in the company. Each bord consists of lists of tasks, cards with descriptions, comments, files and colour tags and dedlines. The menu can be displayed as a calendar--the basic functionality of Trello is free and allows you to work with almost no restrictions. Therefore, my personal oppinion is that in this instance Trello did not made a huge diffrence, it only helped a bit.
        <br>
        <br>
        On the another hand, the Visual Studio Code is a briliant tool. Howver, even here I vent a cross of a few system erors which were required to turn off and on the system in order to work on it. Also, I've learned that the system works diffrent on Mac vs Microsoft--which I found it fairy annoing. To conclude, I feel that the systems used for this project were helpful with a ratio of 6:10.

    <h1>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your

    <br>
    <p> <b>Are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? </b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Yes, I'm quite proud of my work. However, I'll have to recognise that there is space for improvement, and when I say improvement I mean a lot of improvement. For instance; the graphics the colors the spellings, the font in some cases. But honestly, over all, I'm really pround of my work. And I know that this it will be just the beaginning for me—-definetally I will continue to improve my skills set in this path—thanks to Jay.

        Everithing; from graphics, to fonts, to colors, text—in other words the whole concept. But; But—I'm also proud of my first website made by my own hand. Therefore, I'm looking forward to continually develop my HTML skills and to design and build more, and better websites into the future. 
        To conclude, yes I'm really proud of my work even if is not at an excelente standart—but I promised to myself that I will continue to learn and develop my skills set.

    <h1>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project your.</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> "As per Johnson G. (Johnson, G., et all. 2018) planning and timing is the KEY to every project succes."
<br>
On this basis, I would have to recognise that time was not enough in this matter in order to plan the project, learn, develop skills and execute the project. So, into the future i would definetelly, start with a SWOT analysis following by a SMART objective list, as well as a WBS—in detail—in order to have a better understanding of the project reuirments, needs, strengths and weaknesses.
