<h1>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency </h1>
<br>
<p>
<B> Could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</B>
</p>
<P>
    The benefits of the IT tools, such as Slack—some of the biggest benefits using slack were that working in teams on the pervious project, made us to trust ourselves and our colleagues, in order to open ourselves and ask for help when and where we felt stuck.  Slack was also a great way for sharing documents and information among our pears. In contrast, I reckon that Trello was been a drawback and had wasted some valuable time. The reason why I’m saying that is what it took me some good time to go through all the complex requirements in order to set a Trello bord. In addition, I believe that an easiest way of building our WBS might be more efficient for this particular project.
    <br>
    <br>Could we have done this project in teams—yes, we could. However, doing the project on our own was not as fun as could have been if we were working in teams. But I believe that working on our own, it was more challenging and we had to find the solution even if it has required to work till late at night.

<h1> 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h1>

    “Work is a process, and any process needs to be controlled. To make work productive, therefore, requires building the appropriate controls into the process of work.” (Peter F. Drucker, Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices)
   </b> 
   <br>
   <br>

   First, you have to step back and think about what exactly you want your team to be working on. Define key goals and take into consideration your team’s capacity to execute on them. Make sure you have processes in place, and consider HR workflow software, to track your progress.

In the meantime, don’t forget to keep the goals attainable. Assigning one large project even with a reasonable deadline could be overwhelming. Alternatively, breaking large projects into smaller iterations shows clear progress and motivates teammates as they move toward the final product.

The next step is meeting with your team members one-on-one to communicate the priorities and expectations for their roles. First of all, describe the top two or three high priority tasks you want them to focus on. Then estimate the time your employees should devote to these tasks. At the same time, help them understand the quality of the work you are expecting. Then make sure to explain the result you are trying to achieve. And finally, get out of their way—give your employees the freedom to work in the best manner possible.

Develop a culture of trust in your team, providing constructive, meaningful feedback on a regular basis. For instance, ask about the challenges your employees face, how you can help them slice their time more effectively, and whether they need more resources. Don’t hesitate to use the following questions in order to make the feedback process easier:

-- Are the established objectives still relevant?

-- Is there any progress on the work? If not, why? Do some digging to uncover the root of the problem.

-- Is the workload achievable and manageable?

Performance management software helps make sure the process is effective and all employees are performing to the best of their ability.

Teamwork may become messy and mixed up without a centralized space to manage projects. In the same way, collaboration software is especially important if your coworkers are located in different offices and work remotely. The problem is that it can be easy to become confused about where all project data is located, who is doing the tasks, how far along they are in the process and how much work is left.

Having a real-time planning tool that is accessible from everywhere, your team won’t get sucked into hours of meetings and email correspondence. Project management software such as Basecamp or droptask can help you coordinate all the activity in one easy-to-manage, web-based tool.  

If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it. So keep an eye on the metrics that matter for your team. For instance, analyze recent changes in productivity, sales and income, or inspect the latest staff retention rates.

What you should remember is that improving internal communication brings long-term returns. But as a manager, you should understand the halfway results. If you are not satisfied with them, try to utilize other tactics on improving team communication. Otherwise, if you notice a positive trend, scale your efforts.

Productivity is never an accident. If you swing like a pendulum while trying to improve your team productivity, the only goal you’ll reach is wasted time. In order to grow productivity at the workplace, you need to constantly monitor your company’s workflow, and never stop.

<h1> 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h1>
<br>
<p>
    The landscape of emerging and evolving technologies is extremely complex. Technological progress is exponential with the rate of growth in a vast array of metrics doubling in ever decreasing timeframes. This means that organisations are faced with the impossible task of having to make decisions about the benefits of a vast number of technologies. This complexity combined with poor advice explains why most digital transformation projects fail.

Gone are the days when the workplace was merely a physical space employees occupied during regular office hours. Today's always connected, instant access environment has blurred the lines between the physical office and the place where work actually happens. As the distinction between professional and personal life dissolves, and the workplace becomes truly digital, employees are communicating and collaborating in unprecedented ways. To enable knowledge sharing across the organization, they want the ability to forge productive business relationships beyond natural work groups. As a result, it is increasingly clear that the traditional 'create and push' information approach no longer meets employees’ evolving needs.
<br>
<br>
To accurately reflect their staff’s changing work experience, leading organizations have begun to implement an entirely new working environment – the digital workplace. By integrating the technologies that employees use (from e-mail, instant messaging and enterprise social media tools to HR applications and virtual meeting tools), the digital workplace breaks down communication barriers, positioning you to transform the employee experience by fostering efficiency, innovation and growth. The key to success, however, lies in the effective implementation of a digital workplace strategy capable of driving true cultural change.
<br>
<br>
Use: collaborate, communicate, connect
The digital workplace is all about the employees’ ability to do their job by collaborating, communicating and connecting with others. The goal is to forge productive business relationships within and beyond natural work groups and to enable knowledge sharing across the organization.
Technology: the digital toolbox
Technology enables the digital workplace. Each organization already has a digital workplace toolbox with different tools. Depending on your industry and business needs, the tools needed to support your digital workplace will vary. The key is to adopt the right tools for your employees to do their jobs.
Control: governance, risk and compliance
The effective use of technology in the digital workplace is underpinned by appropriate controls. This means you must support the digital workplace with appropriate governance structures and management processes. Information flow and use must also comply with your organization’s policies and industry regulations.
Business drivers: measurable business value
As with any core initiative, it is essential for business needs to drive the digital workplace. To deliver the necessary benefits, the direction of your organization should guide the direction of your digital workplace.

<h1> 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h1>
<br>
<P>
    Target market / audience
    When looking at which devices to test against, one must understand what devices the target market is expected to use. Different countries, types of people, including demographics (age brackets) etc will use different devices to get to your site. You must understand where the majority of risk is and look to mitigate that risk by testing on the most popular platforms.
    Existing breakdown of data / device usage
    If your site is already in existence, analytics software, such as Google Analytics, IBM Digital Analytics (formerly Coremetrics) or Adobe Analytics (formerly Omniture) can be utilised to understand what devices and software are used to access your site. This data can be quite revealing and will help you clarify the scope of your testing.
    Different browsers across different devices
    Although it is standard behaviour for the user to utilise the browser which is installed with the device, sometimes users will install different software to browse with. Let the previous two points drive your testing on this, but it may also be prudent to install different browsers on your devices and test using those. This can include considering internal company devices and browsers for customer support and administration – which can be locked down on a corporate basis.
    Type of customer journey (reset password example), completing E2E process with different devices
    When testing a customer journey, it can be useful to break up the flow and try to complete it using different devices. For example, for a reset password journey, you could trigger the password reset from a desktop device, but complete the password reset from a mobile phone.
    Test against a ‘base browser’ (establish what this is)
    As different browsers can produce different results when testing, we have found it useful to establish a ‘base browser’. This is then used as the source of truth when it comes to comparing behaviours of the system across different devices.
    Browsers under Warranty (browsers, versions, operating systems)?
    Consider what devices, operating systems and browsers are actually under warranty. Often digital companies will state which will be covered under a contracts warranty, which makes sense when there are so many browser types, devices and versions out in the marketplace. By only covering what is under warranty, you will not waste time and resource on testing combinations which are not going to be covered.
